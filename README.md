## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I tried to pay more attention to the analysis of the project: colors, fonts, layout - all this saved me a lot of time later on. So, now I know how to set up my projects.

### Continued development

While working on this project, I played a lot with percentages and rem values. So, now I feel a little more confident with the sizes. I will keep moving forward!
